# Stochastic_Simulation_Assignments

In this folder there are 2 files, the first one is the file in which we put all the figures,
the second file is the file with all the code used in our work.

It is divided in: 
mandelbrot_functions.py
convergence.py
mandelbrot_picture.py
variable_sample_size.py
Calculate_single_area.py

- In the first file we have all the functions used in this work

- In the second file there is the code to make the 2d plots

- In the 3rd file there is the code to make a picture of the fractal

- In the 4th file there is the code to make the 3d plot

- In the 5th file there is the code to compute the area of the fractal for a single value of S and I
